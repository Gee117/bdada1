**Description:-**
To solve this problem, I created a MapReduce program that filters smartphone data based on specific criteria. The goal is to identify phones that meet the following conditions:

1. Internal Memory must be greater than 40 GB.
2. The phone should support 4G.
3. The Pixel Height should be more than 500 pixels.
4. The Pixel Width should be above 1000 pixels.
5. The RAM needs to be greater than 200 MB.
